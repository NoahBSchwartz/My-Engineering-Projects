# My-Engineering-Projects
I've worked on many engineering builds that aren't coding related in the past. From making my own CNC machine to designing boat shoes, my experience with building things has improved my sketching, CAD design, soldering, circuit design, and 3D printing skills. All of these projects except for the school folder were solo builds made at home with whatever materials I had lying around. I used many tutorials and premade cad models (links are in each folder) during my projects. Most of the portfolio is just pictures with a short blurb about each build so feel free to click around!
