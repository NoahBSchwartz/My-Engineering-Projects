# Tree Climbing Robot
This climbing robot was one of my first big projects where I created everything from scratch. I designed my own cad model, printed all of the parts, sketched out and soldered my own circuit, and wrote the climbing code. It was a fun challenge because I had to work with materials that I already had like the weak DC motors which I needed to design gears for. The robot is controlled by an Arduino Nano and l298n motor drivers which boost the arduino's voltage.
