# School Engineering Projects
During my engineering class, I was in several groups that competed and won our school competitions. We made a pair of shoes to walk on water (we got 2nd place), a car to travel a specific distance (1st place), a mouse trap car (2nd place), and a gravity powered vehicle (1st place).
