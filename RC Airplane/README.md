# RC Airplane (Attempts)
This was one of the only projects that I wasn't able to finish. Over the course of multiple years, I tried to create my own RC airplane. I started with a homemade arduio remote circuit (credit to https://www.rcpano.net/2020/02/17/simple-and-cheap-radio-control-making-for-rc-models-diy-rc/) which ended up being too heavy. Once I could get a real remote control, I built a much bigger version of the plane but still had no luck after several tries.
