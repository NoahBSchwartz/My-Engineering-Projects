# My CNC Machine
This was one of the biggest projects that I 3D printed and built. While I didn't design the cad models (credit to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3004773), printing such large parts, learning how to work with g-code, and figuring out how to assemble the machine were great learning experiences.
